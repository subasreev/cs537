Part A: File System Checker
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2016/Projects/p5a.html

- mmap is used to read the file system image
- Inode table blocks are scanned linearly and the checks are performed
- 1d arrays are used to store the data block bitmap and inode usage to compare for allocation discrepancies
- For data block usage, both direct and indirect pointers are scanned
- Most of the functions and structures from mkfs.c of xv6 are imported for reuse

Part B: File System with Small File Optimization
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2016/Projects/p5b.html

- T_SMALLFILE is defined for supporting small files in include/stat.h
- O_SMALLFILE is defined for supporting small files in open function in include/fcntl.h 
- readi(), writei() functions have been modified to read/write the small files from appropriate offset 
- unlink() also needs modification so as to avoid freeing data blocks for small files as the small files have no data blocks
